### What I learned

In this project, I used some CSS properties to help with responsive font size, such as @media, also I learned how to use hover effect, transition, and animation

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

.social-links a {
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: #ededed;
  background-color: #333333;
  text-transform: capitalize;
  font-weight: 600;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 1rem;
  border-radius: 10px;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}
.social-links a:hover {
  color: #1f1f1f;
  background-color: var(--second-color);
}

I want to learn more about responsive websites and how to use the hover effect
